# BeatmapEditor
A fast and easy way to edit existing beatmaps. Just select a song(s) and edit metadata. You can cut intro or ending parts off too.

I basically made this for myself so I can create AR10 practice maps but I hope some of you find this useful. 

###Metadata available for editing:
- Version
- HPDrainRate
- CircleSize
- OverallDifficulty
- ApproachRate
